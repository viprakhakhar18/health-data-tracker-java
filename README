# Health Data Tracking System (Java)

This is a simple console-based Java program that allows a user to log basic health information such as date, symptoms, mood (1–5), and notes.

The program stores entries in a CSV file so they can be saved and loaded across sessions.

## Features

- Add a new health entry
- View all saved entries
- Search entries by date
- Save and load data using a CSV file
- Input validation for mood and date format

## Project Structure

- `HealthEntry.java` – represents a single health record
- `HealthTracker.java` – manages storing and retrieving entries
- `Main.java` – runs the menu system and user interaction
- `data/entries.csv` – stores saved entries

## Concepts Used

- Object-Oriented Programming (separate classes for structure and logic)
- File I/O using CSV format
- Input validation
- ArrayList for managing records

## How to Run

From the project folder:

javac -d out src/*.java  
java -cp out Main  

The file `entries.csv` will be created automatically inside the `data` folder when you save or exit the program.
